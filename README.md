# Password Strength Evaluation Report

## Overview
This repository contains a report evaluating the strength of different passwords. The goal of this project is to understand how password complexity, including length, character variety, and randomness, impacts security against common password attacks.

## Objective
The objective of this task is to:
- Test different passwords with varying complexity.
- Evaluate their strength using online password strength checkers.
- Provide insights and best practices for creating strong passwords.

## Task Summary
In this report, multiple passwords were tested on **PasswordMeter.com** and evaluated for their strength. The findings and tips are summarized in the **Password Strength Evaluation Report** document.

## Report Contents
The main deliverable is a detailed **Password Strength Evaluation Report** that includes:
- An analysis of different password types.
- Password strength scores and feedback from the tool.
- Best practices for creating strong passwords.
- Information on common password attacks and how complexity helps prevent them.

## Files in this Repository
- **password_strength_report.docx**: The final evaluation report (Word format).

## How to Use
This repository is mainly intended to showcase how password complexity affects security. You can:
1. Review the **password_strength_report.docx** to learn about strong and weak passwords.
2. Experiment with your own passwords using password strength checkers to see how they perform.
3. Follow the **best practices** outlined in the report to create secure passwords.

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords
Here are a few tips to make your passwords more secure:
- **Length**: Use at least 12 characters.
- **Variety**: Include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Avoid Dictionary Words**: Refrain from using common words, names, or predictable patterns.
- **Use a Password Manager**: Store and generate strong, random passwords.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: Add an extra layer of security to your accounts.

## Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all possible combinations. Complex and long passwords are harder to crack.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Tries common words and phrases. Avoid using common dictionary words.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Reusing passwords across sites makes you vulnerable to this type of attack.
